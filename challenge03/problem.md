Instructions

Given a phrase, count the occurrences of each word in that phrase.

For the purposes of this exercise you can expect that a word will always be one of:

    A number composed of one or more ASCII digits (ie "0" or "1234") OR
    A simple word composed of one or more ASCII letters (ie "a" or "they") OR
    A contraction of two simple words joined by a single apostrophe (ie "it's" or "they're")

When counting words you can assume the following rules:

    The count is case insensitive (ie "You", "you", and "YOU" are 3 uses of the same word)
    The count is unordered; the tests will ignore how words and counts are ordered
    Other than the apostrophe in a contraction all forms of punctuation are ignored
    The words can be separated by any form of whitespace (ie "\t", "\n", " ")

For example, for the phrase "That's the password: 'PASSWORD 123'!", cried the Special Agent.\nSo I fled. the count would be:

```
that's: 1
the: 2
password: 2
123: 1
cried: 1
special: 1
agent: 1
so: 1
i: 1
fled: 1

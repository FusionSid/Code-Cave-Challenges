Nearest Vowel

Given a letter, created a function which returns the nearest vowel to the letter. If two vowels are equidistant to the given letter, return the earlier vowel.
Examples

nearestVowel("b") ➞ "a"

nearestVowel("s") ➞ "u"

nearestVowel("c") ➞ "a"

nearestVowel("i") ➞ "i"

Notes

    All letters will be given in lowercase.
    There will be no alphabet wrapping involved, meaning the closest vowel to "z" should return "u", not "a".

Title: Longest Increasing Subsequence

Description:

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

An increasing subsequence is a subsequence in which the elements are in strictly increasing order, but not necessarily contiguous.

Example:

Given the array: [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18], the longest increasing subsequence is [2, 3, 7, 101], so the length is 4. Return 4 as the output.

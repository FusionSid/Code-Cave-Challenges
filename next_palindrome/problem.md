A palindrome is a whole number that's the same when read backward in base 10, such as 12321 or 9449.

Given a positive whole number, find the smallest palindrome greater than the given number.
nextpal(808) => 818
nextpal(999) => 1001
nextpal(2133) => 2222

For large inputs, your solution must be much more efficient than incrementing and checking each subsequent number to see if it's a palindrome. Find nextpal(339) before posting your solution.   It might be fun to see whos system can do it the fastest

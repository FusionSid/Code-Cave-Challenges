Given a string containing an algebraic equation, calculate and return the value of x. You'll only be given equations for simple addition and subtraction.
Examples
```
evalAlgebra("2 + x = 19") ➞ 17

evalAlgebra("4 - x = 1") ➞ 3

evalAlgebra("23 + 1 = x") ➞ 24
```

Notes
    There are spaces between every number and symbol in the string.
    x may be a negative number.

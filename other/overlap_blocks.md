Create a function that takes two arguments as input:

    A positive integer that describes the size of a grid. For example, when the value of the argument is 10, a 10x10 grid will be used.
    A list of one or more tuples of size 3. Each tuple represents a block of the grid, and the meanings of the tuple's elements are: 1. The x coordinate. 2. The y coordinate. 3. The range of the block.

The range of a block is the maximum distance from the block situated at the x and y coordinates to other blocks. The distance can't be calculated vertically. The function returns the block that has the most overlaps.
Worked Examples

The tuple `(3, 3, 2)` covers the following blocks: `(1, 3), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (5, 3).`

Here is a visualization of that, when the first argument is 5, and the second argument is `[(3, 3, 2)]`:
```
00100
01110
11111
01110
00100
```
The 1s represent the blocks covered by (3, 3, 2), while the 0s represent empty blocks. The biggest value on the grid is 1, hence most_overlapped_block(5, [(3, 3, 2)]) returns 1.

If the first argument is 5, and the second argument is `[(3, 3, 2), (1, 1, 2)]`, the grid will look like this:
```
00100
01110
21111
12110
11200
```
The 2s represent the blocks of `(3, 3, 2)` and` (1, 1, 2)` that overlap. The biggest value on the grid is 2, hence `most_overlapped_block(5, [(3, 3, 2, (1, 1, 2))])` returns `2`.
Examples
```
most_overlapped_block(10, [(3, 3, 3), (1, 1, 4)]) ➞ 2

most_overlapped_block(10, [(5, 5, 2), (1, 1, 1)]) ➞ 1

most_overlapped_block(10, [(1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2), (1, 1, 3)]) ➞ 3
``` 
Notes

    There can be more than one tuples that look the same in the second argument, like `[(3, 3, 2), (3, 3, 2)]`.
    Remember to not count the blocks that are outside the grid.
    `most_overlapped_block(1, [(10, 10, 1), (10, 10, 1)])` returns `0`.

I don't have the original problem.md for this but here is one i found on google for the same problem

```
Make a function that encrypts a given input with these steps:
Input: “apple”
Step 1: Reverse the input: “elppa”
Step 2: Replace all vowels using the following chart:
a => 0
e => 1
i => 2
o => 2
u => 3
# “1lpp0”
Step 3: Add “aca” to the end of the word: “1lpp0aca”
Output: “1lpp0aca”

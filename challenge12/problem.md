Juan loves the Dakti song and wants to memorize the chorus of the song. His friend sent him the chorus in phrases, but the phrases are somewhat strange; they do not have an order and they have numbers. His friend helps Juan organize the chorus of the song.

Use RegEx, natural sorting, sorting, or lambda functions; your imagination has no limits.

First, organize the words based on the numbers they have, then delete the numbers once they are organized.

Three steps:
"worl2d hell1o " ➞ " hell1o worl2d " ➞ " hello world "

"i2s th1s a3 t4est    " ➞ "th1is i2s a3 t4est" ➞ "this is a test"

"yo2u cr3azy a1re ?  " ➞  "a1re yo2u cr3azy" ➞ "are you crazy"

Here are some examples:

Examples
dakiti("en5tere y2a bab1y y3o 4me s6e not7a cuand8o 9me-ves") ➞ "baby ya yo me entere se nota cuando me-ves"

dakiti("quie3res bebe4r dime1 e5s qu6e qu2e tu7 er8es m9i-bebe") ➞ "ahi donde no has llegado sabes que yo te-llevare"

dakiti("quie3res bebe4r dime1 e5s qu6e qu2e tu7 er8es m9i-bebe") ➞ "dime que quieres beber es que tu eres mi-bebe"

Notes
Trick, natural sort.
